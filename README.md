# Energy Trading Simulator

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will find the prerequisites in the requirements.txt file inside `grid-simulator` folder. Set up your python environment with the required packages.

The dependencies for the UI are defined in `grid-sim-ui-client/package.json`. The run script already handles installing those.

### Running the simulator

To run the simulator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
python run.py
```

## Development

If you don't want to have to build the ui, run the following command:

```bash
python dev.py
```

## Docker

It is not working yet.
